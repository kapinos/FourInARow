Implementation of Test Task

* The main window of the application shows the game board for playing a game of four in a row. 
It contains columns and rows. The game board is initially empty.
* The aim is that 2 players can play, each in turn, by dropping a coin at the top of a column. 
Each player will have his/her own coin color 
* There's no need to be able to play against the computer
* The main window should show clearly which player's turn it is and which color he/she plays with
* When 1 of the 2 players has 4 coins in a row (either horizontally, vertically of diagonally) he/she won the game and this should be shown by a message to the players. The game then ends.
* A new game can be started by clicking the "New Game" menu item in the File menu of the application (it must be possible to restart the game while it is still going on, for example when all places are filled with coins)
